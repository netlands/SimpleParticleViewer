# Simple Particle Viewer
Simple HTML and Javascript based application to view data generated by and control Core and Photon based devices.
The application uses the ParticleJS (Javascript SDK) for communication and control, and MDL (Material Design Lite) components for its interface in order to mimic a native mobile app.

The application can be opened in a browser, either locally or from a network location (e.g., a DopBox public folder)
